      My name is Piotr Romanowski, and this is my first angular2 application. This is a sample app that I created over the past two days to familiarize 
      myself with angular2, and angularfire2, and angular cli. I'll try to answer questions as frequently as I can. This app is stricly experimental 
      and probably has bugs so if you find some please do submit an issue on Github. I'll get around to fixing any bugs as I get the chance.

      If you'd like help with an angular2 app, or simply want to connect all of my contact information is available on 
      <a href="http://piotr.codes"> my website.</a>
